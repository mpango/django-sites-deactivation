# INSTALLATION

* copy the ´site_deactivation´ app to your PYTHON_PATH
* add the ´site_deactivation´ app to your INSTALLED_APPS
* run ´python manage.py syncdb´

A good addition to the ´site_deactivation´ app is [django's flatpages app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/contrib/flatpages/ "django flatpages").

# USAGE

Go to your admin panel and you'll find a new entry
´Site Deactivations / Redirects´ under the ´Sites´ group. In order to
temporarily disable an entire site and let it redirect to a static URL, simply
create a new entry there, specifying the SITE you want to disable and the
redirect URL. This redirect URL could be a reference to a django flatpage.
